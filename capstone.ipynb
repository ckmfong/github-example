    "<h2> Introduction </h2>\n",
    "Canada is one of the most popular places for immigration for Hong Kong citizens. The Chinese Canadian population has been growing since 1960s due to the changes in immigration law and political issues in Hong Kong. The Chinese has established many shops and restuarants to cater their population. As the capital of the province of Ontario, many immigrants favour Toronto as their port of entry. In this project, we would be finding the neighbourhood with the best Chinese resturants in Toronto. This would be valuable for new comers joining the community who prefer to have Chinese food.\n",
